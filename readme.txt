This project was a final for a Computer Science and Music course. All code was written by Andrew Kehler, the max patch was developed by Tyler Kettner.

To run the code run the "main.py" file. Press "q" to close the camera and stop the file.

Ensure that you have both OpenCV and MediaPipe downloaded for Python 3.11.
